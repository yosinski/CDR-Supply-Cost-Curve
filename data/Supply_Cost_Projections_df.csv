STRP008,"['forests', 'reforestation']",Reforestation with verification and monitoring in Rip's Redwoods and Guanare.,Pachama,1,"Rip's Redwoods, Guanare","Project directly reports rates of 16 tCO₂ / ha / yr for the Rip’s Redwoods development, and 26 tCO₂ / ha / yr for Guanare. The total volume estimates are then based on these rates projected over the project durations of 60 and 100 years for the two projects, respectively. The Rip’s Redwoods appears to be a mix of Douglas Fir and Coastal Redwoods. Values in USFS yield tables for Douglas Fir in the Pacific Northwest are as high as 11.56 tCO₂ / ha / yr over a 20 year period (Smith et al., 2005), so the reported rate is very high but not implausible. A more accurate estimate would incorporate stand age, which was not provided, so as to better estimate current growth rates. The Guanare project appears to include mainly eucalyptus, which has published growth rates of 5.02 to 27.65 tCO₂ / ha / yr over an initial 3 years of growth (Ahimana & Maghembe, 1987), so the reported rate is again high but not implausible, but validation would require incorporating stand age.

In both cases, validation of volume estimates would benefit either from additional information on projects, or open sourcing some of the proprietary remote sensing based methods and datasets the project uses. While existing literature using remote sensing for estimating forest carbon stocks is established, and some of it is referenced, this is a complex topic that would benefit from more public data and reproducible methods.

In terms of permanence risk, we have not specifically analyzed fire risk for the Guanare project but it is stated by the project as high. Risk for Rip’s Redwoods, given its ecoregion, is likely low to moderate (Anderegg et al., in publication), and we will soon provide more specific estimates of this risk, alongside risks related to drought and insects. Questions around permanece on the provided time horizon have more to do with socioeconomic risks such as default or bankruptcy.

STRP003,"['soil', 'farming']",Increasing soil carbon sequestration and soil health at Harborview Farms.,Nori,2,Harborview Farms,"Validating the claimed 14011 tCO₂ volume for this project is difficult due to having partial information. Nori provides on its project page the locations and NRTs (claimed sequestered volumes) associated with each plot. Nori specifies in its Croplands Methodology v1.1 a range of possible practices that farmers might adopt to increase soil carbon sequestration, including “changing or expanding crop rotations and cropping intensity, introducing cover crops and/or shifting from annuals to perennials, reducing tillage events and intensity and/or adopting new residue management techniques, adopting new irrigation management techniques, or substituting synthetic fertilizers with organic matter additions”.

Based on independent verification by Aster Global, Inc. provided on the Nori [project website](https://nori.com/verification/VmVyaWZpZXJKb2JSZXBvcnQ6NTcxMDk1NzAzNjY5OTY0OA==), this specific project is ""practicing no till and is using the regenerative agriculture practice of planting the crop directly into the living winter cover crop"". Even knowing these methods, sequestration rates are likely to be highly variable and challenging to quantify (Smith et al., 2019; Sanderman & Baldrock, 2010). Nori provides a range of 0.5 to 7.4 tCO₂ / ha / yr as plausible across a range of practices in its Croplands Methodology. Examples in the literature fall within that range, though are generally on the lower end, e.g. 1.17 ± 0.29 tCO₂ / ha / yr for cover cropping (Poeplau & Don, 2011), 0.92 ± 0.78 tCO₂ / ha / yr for several practices including conversion from conventional tillage to no tillage (Sanderman & Baldrock, 2010), and 1.43 tCO₂ / ha / yr for using no tillage (Sperow, 2015).

To contextualize the project within this range, we inspected a subset of four plots. While shape files were not directly available, we used a [web tool](https://www.mapdevelopers.com/area_finder.php) to approximately estimate four plot areas (Crewe II-1, Colchester 12, Ernies, Elder 1234), and then used the reported sequestration volumes to estimate rates of 6-11 tCO₂ / ha / yr. These would be rather high if meant to reflect 1 year, but Nori’s methodology suggests that this may be a pilot project, in which the claims credits reflect multiple years of sequestration and far more clearly within a plausible range. Thus, we remain uncertain as to the claimed volumes.

The underlying component technologies are well established, and two papers are referenced that present theoretical analysis of the potential for combining them (Schmidt et al., 2019; Werner et al., 2018). We consider the volume validated as it is simply a function of the planned bio-oil procurement. Specifically, given the stated ratio of 1.55 tCO₂ for every 1 t of bio-oil (which corresponds to 42% C content for the bio-oil), we infer that 6452 t bio-oil will be procured.

A minor clarification on negativity is that the project estimates 1.53 tCO₂ removed and 0.347 tCO₂ of process emissions, yielding a ratio of 1 - 0.347 / 1.53 = 0.773. They however report a ratio of 1 - 0.28 = 0.72 , likely because they took a different ratio.

This fits within a broader category of ocean fertilization strategies, which remain unproven with respect to efficacy and monitoring, and are somewhat controversial due to poorly understood potential risks (Williamson et al., 2012). A prototype of the specific proposed method was developed in 2018. Planned measurement is based on deploying biogeochemical (BGC) ARGO robotic float (Bittig et al., 2019) for every 18 pumps. Technology is clearly still early-stage, with key measurements pending and a model simulation unpublished.

STRP011,"['mineralization', 'olivine']",CO₂ removal with olivine.,GreenSand,2,,"A challenge validating this project proposal is that the weathering time scale and exact material procurement underlying the claimed volume are not entirely clear. Based on public details from other deployments on the [project website](https://www.greensand.nl/nieuws), the expected carbon removed in 2020 from weathering for all GreenSand deposits deployed since 2007 totals 361 tCO₂, which comes from (2756 tCO₂ cumulatively removed by 2020) - (2395 tCO₂ cumulatively removed by 2019). It is not clear whether the claimed volume of 1000 tCO₂ reflects the carbon removal expected in one year based on 1) previous deployments that will remove the stated amount in 2020 due to ongoing weathering (which would be at odds with public website information), 2) based on a additional deployment, which would have to be large (potentially tens to hundreds of thousands of tons of olivine), or 3) an amount expected over some unspecified time horizon beyond one year. Further information would be required to validate the given estimate.

In general, the expected volume of carbon removal for olivine depends on the ratio of magnesium to iron, and whether weathering results in alkalization of runoff and/or formation of carbonate precipitates. The ratio of tCO₂ removed per t of olivine can range from 0.61 (assuming 94% magnesium and only precipitation of carbonate minerals) to 1.25 (assuming 100% magnesium and all dissolved bicarbonates) (Montserrat et al., 2017; Renforth & Henderson, 2017). The life cycle analysis references a ratio of 0.75 apparently in regards to this quantity, which falls within a plausible range. But again, without knowing the assumed time scale or the actual volume of olivine procured, we have difficulty validating the reported volume.

If 160 t of olivine were procured, and assuming that ratio, a volume of 200 tCO₂ would be achieved.

The ratio of 1.25 is an upper bound on the realizable ratio. First, significant uncertainty remains around the timescale and extent of olivine cation dissociation in ocean environments, and many factors could reduce yield. Second, in general, for olivine weathering in ocean water, the ratio will depend on 1) the proportion of magnesium to iron in the olivine, 2) the equilibrium ratio of bicarbonates to carbonates in seawater, which itself depends on atmospheric pCO₂ and local alkalinity, and 3) the final state of the stored carbon. If the proportion of magnesium to iron is 1:0 then we calculate the molar mass of olivine of 140.7 g/mol (the molar mass of Mg₂SiO<sub>4</sub>). Only if all the ingassed CO₂ is stored as bicarbonate ions, 1 mole of olivine results in 4 moles of captured carbon, which yields a ratio of 4 \* 44 g/mol CO₂ / 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine = 1.25, the ratio provided in the proposal.

However, using a more realistic ratio of magnesium to iron of 0.94:0.06 (Montserrat et al., 2017) gives a molar mass of olivine of 0.94 x 140.7 g/mol Mg-olivine + 0.06 \* 203.8 g/mol Fe-olivine = 144.49 g/mol. And when using a more realistic bicarbonate to carbonate mole ratio, adding 1 mole of Mg adds between 1.4 and 1.7 moles of carbon (Section 2.3, Renforth & Henderson, 2017), giving a total ratio of about 3.1 x 44 g/mol CO₂ / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.944. In the limiting case where dissolution of olivine directly drives precipitation of carbonate minerals, the ratio could be as low as 2 x 44 g/mol CO₂ / 144.49 g/mol olivine = 0.61, but this limit is unlikely to be reached given precipitation timescales and alkalinity levels.

For the life cycle analysis, the lower ratio would also translate to a lower negativity, holding all other variables constant. A ratio of 0.944, for example, would yield a negativity of 1 - 0.049/0.944 = 0.948.

Thus, while plausible, the reported numbers reflect an upper bound, so we consider them with some uncertainty pending future experiments and data.

In our original project report, we raised questions about the potential involvement of EOR because Carbon Engineering’s first major project in the Permian Basin will use EOR. Both Carbon Engineering and Microsoft have since confirmed that offering non-EOR volume was a precondition of Carbon Engineering’s proposal, and thus the proposal should be read as offering removal volume with non-EOR geologic sequestration or carbon utilization.
